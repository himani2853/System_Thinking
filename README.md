# System_Thinking

• Implemented the dynamic behavior of a 2-link manipulator system with the help of MATLAB.

• Developed Proportional-Derivative (PD), Proportional-Integral (PI), and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for the manipulator.

• Simulated the above controllers and incorporated specified system parameters and parametric values to ensure accuracy in the simulation.

• A comparative analysis is done by plotting joint angles (q1 and q2) against time (t) which provides a visual representation of the distinct responses produced by each controller.

• Selected and fine-tuned the Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D) gains for each controller to achieve the objective of bringing the joint angles to [0 0].
